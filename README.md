# Lecture_Boards
Lecture boards is an application that allows users to interact with their lecturer in real-time It uses the same "hash-tagging" approach as twitter to allow lecturers to easily find posts directed at them. 

Lecture boards is written using angularJS, bootstrap and Firebase for data storage.
